4-Project Description:
     The project is about building-up a complete, elegant and modern website for a Freelance
Photographer named "Aaron", in an attractive way that would show his talent in shooting live
photos, in a way that allows you to hear not just see his photographs....
Technically, more than the covered topics for the last 5 weeks so far will need to be applied,
so we'll make use of the instructors' experience as much as needed, specially in implementing
animated effects using only CSS without JS....
Waiting for the approval to start deciding and setting each team members' role...
